#### Advanced Git
During the workshop, we will go through several advanced Git features. The best
way of learning them though, is being on the necessity of using them. We will
provoke these situations so that you can practice with Git.

[Here](https://github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/raw/master/DOCS/tower_cheatsheet_grey_EN.pdf) 
you can find a very good cheat sheet on git commands ([source](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet-detail/)).

[Here](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim-resolving-merge-conflicts-with-vimdiff/) a very recommendable 
vimcast about how to solve a merge conflict with VIM.
