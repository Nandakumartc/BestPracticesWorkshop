###IPython
One of Pythonâ€™s most useful features is its interactive interpreter. It allows for 
very fast testing of ideas without the overhead of creating test files as is typical 
in most programming languages. However, the interpreter supplied with the standard 
Python distribution is somewhat limited for extended interactive use.

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) is an alternative to the standard Python interpreter
which goal is to create a comprehensive environment for interactive and exploratory computing. 
To support this goal, IPython provides an enhanced interactive Python shell. You
can read detailed documentation [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/overview.html),
but these are some of the main features:

1 - Easily check methods and attributes of an object with the syntax `<object>. + TAB`:

       alt="Show object methods with <object>. + TAB"/>
</p>

2 - Read the docstring of any method with `<object>.<method>?` **(Hey! Docstrings are useful!)**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw2.github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/master/images/ipython_show_docstring.png"
       alt="Show method docstring with <object>.?"/>
</p>

3.- Look at a method's/function's code without opening any file with `<object>.<method>??`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw2.github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/master/images/ipython_show_code_1.png"
       alt="Show method code with <object>.??"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw2.github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/master/images/ipython_show_code_2.png"
       alt="Show method code with <object>.??"/>
</p>

4.- Directly write functions on the interpreter:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw2.github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/master/images/ipython_interactive_programming.png"
       alt="Write anything directly on the interpreter!"/>
</p>

5.- [Magic functions](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html)! 
To help you copy code into the interpreter and a lot more stuff:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw2.github.com/guillermo-carrasco/BestPracticesWorkshop/master/images/ipython_magic_functions.png"
       alt="Copy paste code without indentation problems"/>
</p>

And more... just read the docs :-)
